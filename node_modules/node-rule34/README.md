# node-rule34
An NPM Package designed for grabbing images from [Rule34.xxx](https://rule34.xxx/)

# Note: This package isn't finished and is a work in progress. I'll update the package as I go.

## Installation

```

```

## Methods and Usage

Currently, there is only one method. It returns an Array of however many posts you set the limit to.

### posts(*params*)
params:
- tags (must be an array containing all of the tags you would like to search for.)
- limit (however many posts you want to get.)
- pid (the current page id.)

Examples:

```js

const posts = require('node-rule34').posts;

let ex = posts({ tags: ["tags", "here"], limit: 5, pid: 0 });

console.log(ex); // returns an array of posts based opon what is up here.
```
